# rbl-custom-optionpage
Custom option-page for Wordpress-developers

This is a plugin created for developers - that is why it is only available on github.

The plugin is made to make it easy for other developers to create a settings-page for their custom Wordpress-sites.

If you create the theme and plugins from scratch, it is nice to have a place to put in all the settings, such as links for social-network, address-lines and other contact-info, and custom links.
